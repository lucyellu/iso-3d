## Attribution

The flip-card clock is adapted from Adem Ilter's CodePen, [Countdown Clock](https://codepen.io/ademilter/pen/nazxPX), rewritten locally without jQuery or external runtime dependencies for Manifest V3. The warm grainy palette is inspired by Juxtopposed's [Grainy Gradient, Gaussian Blur](https://codepen.io/Juxtopposed/pen/BaqLEQY), and the interactive liquid motion is inspired by Cameron Knight's [Interactive Liquid Gradient using Three.js](https://codepen.io/cameronknight/pen/ogxWmBP).
